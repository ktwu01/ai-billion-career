# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to organize the project's root directory by moving process-oriented markdown documents into the `/docs` folder. The root directory is currently cluttered with numerous `.md` report files, which makes it hard to navigate. Moving them to a dedicated documentation folder will improve project structure and maintainability.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

The main challenge is to correctly identify which `.md` files are "process-oriented". Based on the filenames, all `.md` files in the root directory appear to be reports, analysis, or documentation of some process (e.g., `..._report.md`, `..._analysis.md`). Therefore, the plan is to move all of them. There are no apparent risks with this operation, as it's a simple file organization task.

## High-level Task Breakdown

The task is to move a list of specified markdown files from the project root into the `docs/` directory.

## Project Status Board

- [x] Task 1: Move markdown files from root to `/docs` directory.
  - **Success Criteria:** All the specified `.md` files are no longer in the root directory and are present in the `/docs` directory. The list of files to move is:
    - `ai_career_dashboard_goal_constraint_fix_report.md`
    - `ai_career_dashboard_recent_progress_fix_report.md`
    - `ai_career_dashboard_status_constraint_fix_report.md`
    - `ai_career_dashboard_ui_content_replacement_report.md`
    - `ai_career_dashboard_ui_modification_final_report.md`
    - `ai_career_planning_comprehensive_enhancement_report.md`
    - `ai_career_planning_website_research_report.md`
    - `ai_career_platform_modification_report.md`
    - `ai_career_platform_testing_report.md`
    - `dashboard_layout_test_report.md`
    - `database_schema_fix_report.md`
    - `database_schema_fix_test_report.md`
    - `english_ui_update_test_report.md`
    - `minimax_homepage_analysis_report.md`
    - `phase1-2-analysis-report.md`
    - `phase1-2-implementation-report.md`
    - `phase2-optimization-completion-report.md`
    - `profile_status_test_report.md`
    - `supabase_auth_config_update_report.md`
    - `ui_dashboard_test_report.md`

- [x] Task 2: Identify and `.gitignore` large files (>1MB).
  - **Success Criteria:** A list of files larger than 1MB is generated, and each file is individually added to the `.gitignore` file.
- [x] Task 3: List all project files sorted by size.
  - **Success Criteria:** A list of all files, sorted from largest to smallest, is displayed to the user.

- [x] Task 4: Estimate the size of the Git repository.
  - **Success Criteria:** The total size of the project directory is calculated and reported to the user as an estimate of the repository size.

- [ ] Task 5: Prepare project for initial push.
  - **Success Criteria:** All project files are staged and committed, ready for the user to push.
  - **Sub-tasks:**
    - [ ] 5a: Add all untracked files to the staging area.
    - [ ] 5b: Create the initial commit.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Task 1 is complete.** The markdown files have been successfully moved to the `/docs` directory.

**For Task 2:** I searched for files larger than 1MB, but none were found. This task is complete as there are no files to ignore.

**Task 3 is complete.** I have listed the top 30 largest files for the user.

**Task 4 is complete.** The estimated size of the repository is 21MB.

I am now planning Task 5: Prepare the project for the initial push. I will handle `git add` and `git commit`. The user will handle `git push` manually.
